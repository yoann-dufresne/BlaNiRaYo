main.py: unused example for parser

knap.py: first knapsack implementation with straightforward MIP
knap2.py: with Yoann's idea to optimize over books scores instead of libraries potential (<-The one we ended up using)
graveyard/knap_e.py: post-hoc version to optimize instance e, never lead anywhere
knap3.py: post-hoc version to optimize instance e, gave good results
knap4.py: post-hoc version to optimize istances e and f, gave optimal for e

best score for f:
(soon) knap4.py
knap2.py 
(with uncommented tweaks)

best score for e:
knap4.py
second best: knap3.py

best score for b:
urgency.py
and confirmed with knap3.py as each book is in a single library

best score for c:
knap2.py with f_factor = 0.5
rest: 
urgency.py
