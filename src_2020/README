main.py: unused example for parser

knap.py: first knapsack implementation with straightforward MIP
knap2.py: with Yoann's idea to optimize over books scores instead of libraries potential (<-The one we ended up using)
knap_e.py: post-hoc version to optimize instance e, never lead anywhere
knap3.py: post-hoc version to optimize instance e, gave good results


best score for f:
knap2.py

best score for e:
knap3.pe

rest: urgency.py I think
